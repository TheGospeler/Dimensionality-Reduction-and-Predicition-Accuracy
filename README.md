### Dimensionality-Reduction-and-Predicition-Accuracy
This repository contains a detailed solution to a predictive model I created based on a technical interview.

A decent amount of time was spent on the data analysis regarding the best features to use for the predictions, which led to the optimal predictions of the machine learning problem.

#### Folder / Files:
- **Data**: This folder contains the data used for this model.
  - *Target.csv*: Contains the response variable to be predicted.
  - *Predictors.csv*: Features used to predict the eventual targets.

- **Predictive Model.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing codes and output
					for the ML model developed. Included for the
					the convenience of reproducing the results obtained.
 
- **John Salako Predictive Model.pdf:** Converted Jupyter notebook
- **R Analysis.Rmd:** Contains the R markdown file for the analysis done in R.
					    R was used for dimensionality reduction
					    analysis because of the need to identify the
					    key site features for each of the traits rather
					    than using PCA or other dimensionality reduction
					    technique.
              
- **John Salako PowerPoint.pdf:** Contains the summary workflow used in building 
					    the ML model highlights the processes in the notebook and R markdown files.
              
              
This predictive model was a very exciting project for me, as it covers the entirety of Data Science. 
The necessity of Exploratory Data Analysis was heightened as EDA helped remove
visible redundant features and also helped in the data missingness analysis.

ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ The Lasso and Forward Regression methods used were the method I learned in the Statistical Computing Class (STT 802) I took in the Fall Semester of 2022.

Finally, this was one of the most interesting machine-learning projects I have done so far!

**NOTE: ** Most of the color used for the visualization of the data was
			   the **viridis palette** as it compensates for color blindness and 
			   accommodates soothing color visualization of data to a wider audience.
